# Exercise Async Callback

Write a function called `repeatHello`, which will take as parameters a callback.
The callback function will simply print "Hello".
The `repeatHello` function will have to execute the callback function with an interval of 1 second.

Tips:

- The `setInterval` method will be useful
- The callback function must be an arrow function, can you also explain why?
