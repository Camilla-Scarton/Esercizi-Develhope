# Exercise Async Callback

Write a function called `printAsyncName`, which will take as parameters a callback and a string (which will be name). The callback function will simply print "Hello".
The `printAsyncName` function will have to execute the callback function after an interval of 1 second. After an interval of 2 seconds, we must print the name that we take as a parameter.

Tips:

- The `setTimeout` method will be useful
- The callback function must be an arrow function, can you also explain why?
