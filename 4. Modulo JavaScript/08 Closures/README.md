# Exercise Closures

Write a new `closure`: create a function called `multiplyByTwo` that takes in one parameter.
Inside the `multiplyByTwo` function, create a function called `inner`. This function will take care of multiplying the parameter passed as input and multiply it by the variable named `number`
Print in the console the function output.

Example: `multiplyByTwo(4)()`, result: `8`
