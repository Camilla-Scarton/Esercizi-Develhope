Create a `CarDetails` uncontrolled form that uses the HTML Form API to allow the user to insert details about a car, such as the `model`, the `year` and the `color`. Allow the form to receive a `initialData` prop that contains the default values of each input, and reset the form every time the `initialData` value changes.
