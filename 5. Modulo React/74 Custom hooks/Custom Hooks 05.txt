Write the `useCurrentLocation` custom hook, that uses the browser's `navigator.geolocation` API to get the current location of the user through the `getCurrentPosition` builtin method. The hook should return the current location as well as a function to get the current location, and the error and loading states. The details on how to use this API can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API/Using_the_Geolocation_API
