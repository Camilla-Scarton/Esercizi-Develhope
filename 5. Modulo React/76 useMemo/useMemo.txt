Create a `FilteredList` component that receives a list of objects each containing a `name`, an `id` and a `age` prop. The `FilteredList` component should render only the items of the list whose `age` is greater than 18, and the filtering should only happen when the list changes. Use `useMemo` to memoize the filtered list.
