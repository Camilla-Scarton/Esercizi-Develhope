Create a `TodoList` component that renders a `ul` tag with a `li` tag for each item contained in the `items` _state variable_. The `items` state variable should be an array of strings. The `TodoList` component should also contain an `input` tag and a `button`. When the `button` is clicked, the event handler should add the value of the `input` tag to the `items` array.
