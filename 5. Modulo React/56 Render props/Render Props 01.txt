Modify the `TodoList` component so that, instead of rendering the `items` array within the `ul` tag, it calls the function passed to its `render` prop, passing it the `items` array as a parameter, as well as the function required to delete the item. Pass a render prop to the `TodoList` component to correctly render and interact with the `items` array.

The TodoList call the function passed in the render prop. This function takes as input the items array. 
The render prop is for rendering the items in the list, but the delete function has to work as well.
The render prop in the TodoList has to interact with the items array to render properly.
