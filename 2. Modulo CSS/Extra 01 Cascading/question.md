Edit the style.css.

The `link1`,` link2`, `link3` classes must change the text color and padding so that:
- class link1 inherits values from its parent
- class link2 sets the values to the initial ones
- class link3 restores the properties to their natural value
- The paragraphs inside the `blockquote` with the class `content1` must have a solid 1px border.
- The class `variant-em` must have a `greenyellow` background, black color/bold text and inherit the `font-style` from the parent
