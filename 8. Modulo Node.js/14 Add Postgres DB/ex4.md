# NodeJS Part 2 :: Exercise 4 :: Add Postgres DB

## Do

- Using PgAdmin:
  - Create a Postgres DB.
- Using a `setupDb` function:
  - Create `planets` table.
  - Populate the table with two planets (e.g. `'Earth'` and `'Mars'`).
- Connect your app to Postgres using Express (`pg-promise`). [https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise]
- Replace the dummy DB with the Postgres DB.
- Rewrite all planets controller functions. They should now work with the DB. (Use the SQL queries below.)

## Use

- SQL query to create the table:

  ```sql
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS planets;

  CREATE TABLE planets(
    id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
  );
  ```

- Make sure that all CRUD operations read from and write to Postgres (instead of the dummy db you've been using in previous exercises).
  - `GET /planets`
    - Use this SQL query:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM planets;
      ```
  - `GET /planets/:id`
    - Use this SQL query:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM planets WHERE id=$1;
      ```
    - Make sure that `$1` is `id`.
  - `POST /planets`
    - Use this SQL query:
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO planets (name) VALUES ($1);
      ```
    - Make sure that `$1` is `name`.
  - `PUT /planets/:id`
    - Use this SQL query:
      ```sql
      UPDATE planets SET name=$2 WHERE id=$1;
      ```
    - Make sure that `$1` is `id` and `$2` is `name`.
  - `DELETE /planets/:id`
    - Use this SQL query:
      ```sql
      DELETE FROM planets WHERE id=$1;
      ```
    - Make sure that `$1` is `id`.

## Check

- Use Postman to test the routes.
