# NodeJS Part 2 :: Exercise 5 :: Upload files

## Do

- Add `image` field to `planets` table in the DB.
- Set `POST /planets/:id/image` route for file upload (planet's image).
- Store the image file locally (on disk).
- Save file path to DB (update the correct planet).

## Use

- Add `image TEXT` to your `CREATE TABLE planets` SQL query.
- Use `multer` library to save files to `/uploads` folder.
- Add `image TEXT` to `CREATE TABLE planets` SQL query (in your DB setup).
- Use this SQL query to update planet's image:

  ```sql
  UPDATE planets
  SET image=$2
  WHERE id=$1;
  ```

## Check

- Use Postman to test the upload route (you can send a file in Postman).
